Use wispbit in different scenarios:


### Claude Code

Use a prompt

```text
run a code review using "npx @wispbit/cli@latest review" and address any violations
```

Ideally, chain it after running a task

```text
create a button on the home page

run a code review using "npx @wispbit/cli@latest review" and address any violations
```
